# NOTE: Oracle requires at least 1176 MB of swap (or something around there).
# If you are using CentOS in a VMWare VM, there's a good chance that you don't have enough by default.
# If this describes you and you need to add more swap, see the
# "Adding a Swap File to a CentOS System" section, here:
# http://www.techotopia.com/index.php/Adding_and_Managing_CentOS_Swap_Space

# Install basic dependencies
sudo yum -y install libaio bc flex
